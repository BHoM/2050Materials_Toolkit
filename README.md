# template-repository
This repository can be used to create brand new BHoM Toolkits :rocket:

- Just click on the green button above "Use this template" :point_up_2: . Call the new repo with the name of your software followed by `_Toolkit`, e.g. "MySoftware_Toolkit". If you want to develop outside of a repository, you can download the code by clicking "Code" and then saving it as zip.
- Go in your repository or unzipped folder, double click the `RenameToolkitFiles.bat` file. When asked, insert the name of your software, e.g. "MySoftware". All the files and folder will be renamed accordingly.
- Start developing! :rocket:
